The News API Web Application is a responsive web project developed as part of the CODTECH Internship Program. The main goal of this project is to understand and implement API integration by fetching real-time data from a public API and displaying it dynamically on a webpage.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It does not use any backend or database, making it simple and efficient. The application fetches live news data from a public News API using JavaScript’s Fetch API. The data is received in JSON format and displayed on the webpage without reloading the page.

The user interface is designed to be responsive, so it works smoothly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop devices. CSS is used to create a clean layout and display news articles in card format. To improve user experience, a dark mode feature is added that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.

The application includes several useful features. Users can search news articles using keywords and filter news by category such as Business, Sports, Technology, and Health. A loading spinner is shown while the data is being fetched, which lets users know that the application is processing their request.

Each news article is displayed with a title, short description, and a “Read More” link that opens the full article on the original news website. This keeps the application simple while still providing access to detailed information.

The project is deployed using GitHub Pages, making it accessible online through a live link. A README file is included to explain the project details, features, and steps to run the application.

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates the use of public APIs, dynamic data loading, and responsive web design. It fulfills all the internship requirements and helps in understanding real-world frontend web development concepts.
